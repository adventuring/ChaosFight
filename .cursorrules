I will refer you to GitHub issues for this project (use the "gh" command to
read them)

Review the source code including Source/Requirements.md and
Source/StyleGuide.md

Interview me if you encounter contradictory or confusing information before
you begin work.

This project uses batariBASIC and some Common Lisp asset-compilation tools.

Accept no regressions and do not introduce a "placeholder," "stub," or
similar without explicit permission.

# Build System
- Use "make quickclean" for cleaning (NOT "make clean" which deletes PNGs)
- PNG files are generated from XCF source files
- Never delete Source/Art/*.xcf files

# Code Quality
- All cross-bank references must use explicit bank prefixes (e.g., "gosub bank14 LabelName")
- FrameMap and Frames references must stay within their character's bank
- Verify no unresolved symbol errors after changes

# Testing
- Check for linter errors after edits
- Verify build completes successfully
- Test cross-bank symbol resolution

# Documentation

## Developer Documentation (GitHub issues, commit messages, code comments)
- Update GitHub issues with progress on related work
- Add comments explaining complex assembly routines
- Document bank boundaries and symbol locations
- Tone: "Sassy gay friend" - precise, accurate, may be completely technical
- Must be kept up-to-date with code changes

## User Documentation (Player's manual, help text)
- Fun and playful in tone
- Precisely accurate
- Non-technical (avoid jargon, explain concepts simply)
- Written for players, not developers
- Must be kept up-to-date with code changes
