## Questions for User

### 1. Weight Precision
- Bernie shows 4.54 kg (10 lbs) - is this correct? Should we round to 5 kg or keep 4.54?
- Other weights appear to be rounded (e.g., 85 kg, 110 kg) - should Bernie be consistent?

### 2. Harpy Description
- Line 28-29: "The Harpy can maintain flight by repeatedly flapping her wings (jump button or up on the joystick)"
- **Question**: Is this phrasing clear enough, or should it be simplified? Maybe: "The Harpy can maintain flight by repeatedly pressing UP (jump button)"

### 3. Character Special Abilities - Verification Needed
Please verify all special abilities are accurately described:

- **Bernie**: No jumping; wraps from bottom to top; fall damage immunity ✅
- **Curler**: Stone comes from character's feet ✅
- **Dragon of Storms**: Free flight (no gravity); fires fireballs ✅
- **Zoe Ryen**: High jumps, fast horizontal laser beam ✅
- **Fat Tony**: Geography expert, magic ring wielder; magic ray attacks ✅
- **Megax**: Giant monster-eating powerhouse; fire breath (adjacent attack) ✅
- **Harpy**: Can "fly" by repeatedly pressing UP; reduced gravity; diagonal swoop attack ✅
- **Knight Guy**: Armored fighter; sword swing visual ✅
- **Frooty**: FREE FLIGHT - use UP/DOWN to move vertically; no guard action ✅
- **Nefertem**: Loyalist to the High Council; heavy melée fighter ✅
- **Ninjish Guy**: Highest jumps, fastest movement, 50% fall damage reduction ✅
- **Pork Chop**: Standard heavy melée fighter ✅
- **Radish Goblin**: Highest jumps, fastest movement, lowest health, bounces when moving ✅
- **RoboTito**: No jumping! Stretches vertically to ceiling; fall damage immunity ✅
- **Ursulo**: Powerful melée attack, hardest to knock back ✅
- **Shamone**: Attack also causes jump (jump+attack combo); light melée fighter ✅

### 4. Content Accuracy Questions
- **Harpy attack type**: Currently says "Melée (diagonal swoop)" - is this correct? The attack involves character movement, not a separate projectile.
- **RoboTito stretch mechanics**: Is the description now clear enough about how the stretch works?
- **Arena selection**: Is the documentation accurate? Player 1 uses LEFT/RIGHT, FIRE starts game, other players can hold FIRE or press SELECT to go back?

### 5. Style Questions
- **Character descriptions**: Are the narrative descriptions appropriate length?
- **Original game references**: Should we keep all purchase/download/forum links, or simplify?
- **Weight information**: User said to keep weights - are all weights correctly rounded (except Bernie at 4.54)?
