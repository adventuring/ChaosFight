Bernie cannot jump, but he can fall off the bottom of the screen and reappear
at the top! 

His unique "Ground Thump" attack hits both in front AND behind simultaneously, 
making him dangerous in crowds. 
He thumps the ground so hard that it affects anyone to either side of him,
shoving them rapidly away!

Bernie's tough constitution grants complete
immunity to fall damage.
