Bernie cannot jump, but he can fall off the bottom of the screen and reappear
at the top! His unique attack hits both in front AND behind simultaneously 
(dual-direction AOE), making him dangerous in crowds. His small ranged projectile
(1×1 pixel) travels horizontally. Bernie's tough constitution grants complete
immunity to fall damage.
