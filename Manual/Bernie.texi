Bernie cannot jump, but he can fall off the bottom of the screen and reappear
at the top! 

His unique attack hits both in front AND behind simultaneously 
(dual-direction AOE), making him dangerous in crowds. 
He can thump the ground so hard that it affects anyone to either side of him!

Bernie's tough constitution grants complete
immunity to fall damage.
