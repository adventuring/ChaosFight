@end enumerate

@strong{Troubleshooting:}

@table @strong
@item No picture

@item Multicart users
Navigate multicart menu to ChaosFight ROM before starting.
@end table

@subsection SECAM and Flashing Behaviour

On SECAM consoles, luminance is not adjustable. ChaosFight uses distinct player index colors at all times (Player 1: Blue, Player 2: Red, Player 3: Yellow, Player 4: Green). When a character is hurt on SECAM, the sprite color becomes MAGENTA to clearly indicate the state.

When flashing effects are enabled (e.g., invulnerability or selection emphasis), ChaosFight alternates between bright and dim variants of the player index colors based on time, ensuring visibility without compromising gameplay clarity. In B&W mode, flashing alternates greys of different brightness.

@c ============================================================
@node Controller Configuration
@chapter Controller Configuration

@cindex controllers
@cindex joystick

ChaosFight supports multiple controller types with automatic detection. Button
mappings vary by controller type.

@section CX-40 Joystick (Standard Controller)

@table @strong
@item Joystick
@itemize @bullet
@item LEFT/RIGHT: Move and turn character
@item UP: Jump (height varies by character weight)
@item DOWN: Guard (blocks damage for 1 second)
@end itemize

@item Fire Button
Attack with character's weapon (melée strike or ranged projectile)
@end table

Plug Player 1 into left port, Player 2 into right port.

@section Genesis/Mega Drive Controllers

Genesis controllers (3-button and 6-button) supported with automatic detection.
6-button models work fine; extra buttons (X, Y, Z, Mode) are not used.

@table @strong
@item D-Pad
@itemize @bullet
@item LEFT/RIGHT: Move and turn
@item DOWN: Guard
@item UP: Jump (traditional method, always works)
@end itemize

@item Button B (Middle)
Attack (standard fire button via INPT4/5)

@item Button C (Top Right)
Jump (alternative to UP - requires paddle port detection via INPT0/2)

@item Buttons A and START
Not usable (hardware limitation)
@end table

@strong{Technical:} Button C detection requires reading INPT0 (P1) or INPT2 (P2) paddle ports after grounding via VBLANK.

@strong{Note:} Genesis controllers disable Quadtari 4-player mode. Use CX-40
joysticks for 4-player games.

    Fig. C - Joy2B+ Style Controller
@end group
@end display

Joy2B+ controllers are modern enhanced joysticks designed for the Atari Video Computer System,
featuring three fire buttons and improved build quality.

@strong{How to Use It in ChaosFight:}

Joy2B+ controllers provide enhanced control with dedicated buttons:

@table @strong
@item Directional Control
Move the stick or D-pad:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{LEFT/RIGHT:} Move and turn your fighter
@item @strong{DOWN:} Guard (block attacks)
@item @strong{UP:} Jump (traditional method, always works)
@end itemize

@item Button I (INPT4/5)
@strong{Attack} - Standard fire button
@itemize @bullet
@item Melée characters: Close-range strike
@item Ranged characters: Fire projectile
@item Lock in character selection
@end itemize

@item Button II (INPT0/2)
@strong{Jump} - Alternative to UP (via paddle port)
@itemize @bullet
@item Jump height varies by character weight
@item Combine with LEFT/RIGHT for diagonal jumps
@item Confirm menu choices
@item Allows simultaneous attack + jump on separate buttons
@end itemize

@item Button III (INPT1/3)
@strong{Pause} - Alternative to Game Select (via paddle port)
@itemize @bullet
@item Freezes gameplay immediately
@item Press again to resume
@item More convenient than console switch
@end itemize

@item Additional Buttons
Extra buttons vary by Joy2B+ model and are not used by ChaosFight.
@end table

@strong{Technical Note:} Joy2B+ uses INPT0/1/2/3 (paddle/pot ports) for Buttons II and III. Detection requires grounding paddle ports via VBLANK and checking for HIGH state.

@strong{Why Choose Joy2B+?}

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Modern build quality:} New controllers, no wear and tear
@item @strong{Three dedicated buttons:} Attack, jump, and pause mapped to separate
buttons for ultimate control!
@item @strong{Most advanced control:} The only controller with pause button support
@item @strong{Comfortable design:} Ergonomic shapes for long gaming sessions
@item @strong{Compatible everywhere:} Works with all Atari VCS games
@item @strong{Best for competitive play:} Separate attack and jump buttons enable
advanced techniques
@end itemize

@strong{Important Note:}

Like Genesis controllers, Joy2B+ controllers @strong{cannot be used with Quadtari}
for 4-player mode. If you want to play with four players, use standard CX-40
joysticks with a Quadtari adapter!

@section Four-Player Mode with Quadtari

@display
@group
    Quadtari Adapter

    PORT 1 (Even Frame)      PORT 2 (Odd Frame)
    Player 1 / Player 3      Player 2 / Player 4
@end group
@end display

The Quadtari uses time-multiplexing to support four controllers on two ports:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Even frames:} Reads Player 1 (left port) and Player 2 (right port)
@item
@strong{Odd frames:} Reads Player 3 (left port) and Player 4 (right port)
@end itemize

The game automatically detects Quadtari by checking the INPT4/INPT5 lines
during the Title screen.

@section Genesis Controller Mode

Sega Genesis 3-button controllers are supported with specific button mapping:

@table @strong
@item D-Pad
@itemize @bullet
@item LEFT/RIGHT: Move and turn
@item DOWN: Guard
@item UP: Not used (jump via Button C)
@end itemize

@item Button B
Attack (standard fire button - functions as joy0fire/joy1fire)

@item Button C
Jump (via TH line - requires SELECT toggling and reading INPT0/2)

@item Button A and START
Cannot be reliably detected on Atari VCS hardware

@strong{Technical Note:} Button C requires toggling the TH (SELECT) line via SWACNT register and reading INPT0 (P1) or INPT2 (P2). This is more complex than standard button reading.
@end table

@strong{Note:} Genesis controllers and Quadtari cannot be used together.
The game will detect which type is connected.

@section Joy2B+ Controller Mode

Joy2B+ enhanced controllers are supported with the same button mapping as
standard joysticks. The additional buttons are not used in ChaosFight.

@strong{Note:} Joy2B+ and Quadtari cannot be used together.

@section Controller Detection

The game detects your controller configuration:

@enumerate
@item
When you press Game Select on the console
@item
When returning to the Title screen from any game mode
@item
During the initial Title screen display
@end enumerate

The detection checks for:
@enumerate
@item
Quadtari adapter (INPT4/INPT5 signature)
@item
Genesis controller (read mode register)
@item
Joy2B+ controller (extended INPT registers)
@item
Standard joysticks (default)

      [==]         (wait)  xxxxxx         [==]
@end group
@end display

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each attack has a cooldown period (15-20 frames)
@item
You cannot attack again until cooldown expires
@item
Watch for your character's animation to return to idle
@item
Don't spam the fire button - time your strikes!
@end itemize

@subsection Effective Guarding

@display
@group
    INCOMING!                    GUARD!

@subsection Four-Player Strategies

@display
@group
         [P1]
              \
    [P4] ----  ---- [P2]
              /
         [P3]

    Stay unpredictable in FFA!
@end group
@end display

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Avoid the centre} - you'll be surrounded!
@item
@strong{Let others fight} - third-party while they're distracted
@item
@strong{Target the leader} - whoever has most health is the threat
@item
@strong{Stay mobile} - standing still means getting hit from multiple angles
@item
@strong{Use revenge attacks} - immediately counterattack whoever hit you
@end itemize

@section Character-Specific Tips

@table @strong
@item Bernie
Use your dual-direction attack when surrounded. Your screen wrap is great
for surprise attacks from above!

@item Robo Tito
Your vertical extension reaches the entire screen height. Use it to avoid
ground attacks!

@item Harpy
Maintain flight by rapidly tapping UP. Swoop down for devastating diving attacks!
Your labyrinth-tested combat skills make you deadly in aerial manoeuvres.

@item Frooty
Your free flight makes you incredibly mobile, but remember you can't guard!
Stay out of melée range. Use your lollipop weapon's magical sparkles for 
ranged combat while maintaining aerial superiority!

@item Curling Sweeper
Your low projectile is hard to jump over. Fire and immediately jump yourself
to create a two-level attack!

@item EXO Pilot
Your long-range missiles are perfect for cross-screen combat. Keep maximum
distance!

@subsection Performance Optimizations

ChaosFight uses frame budgeting to maintain consistent 60 FPS (NTSC) / 50 FPS (PAL):

@enumerate
@item
@strong{Health Bar Updates:} 1 player per frame (4-frame cycle)

@item
@strong{Collision Detection:} Spread across 3 frames in 4-player mode
@itemize @bullet
@item Frame 0: Check 2 collision pairs
@item Frame 1: Check 2 collision pairs
@item Frame 2: Check 2 collision pairs
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Missile Collisions:} Alternating frames check different missiles

@item
@strong{Animation Updates:} Characters update on staggered frames
@end enumerate

This ensures game logic never exceeds the overscan period (~1950 CPU cycles
on NTSC, ~1630 cycles on PAL).

@subsection Audio System

@table @strong
@item Sound Channels
2 channels (TIA AUDC0/AUDC1)
@itemize @bullet
@item Channel 0: Music (title and preamble screens only)
@item Channel 1: Sound effects (gameplay only)
@end itemize

@item Music Format
@itemize @bullet
@item Converted from MuseScore (MSCZ) to MIDI to TIA data
@item Stored as data tables: instrument, frequency, duration
@item Three songs: AtariToday, Interworldly, Chaotica
@end itemize

@item Sound Effects
@itemize @bullet
@item "Chirp" for character selection
@item Attack sounds (melée and ranged)
@item Impact sounds
@item Victory fanfare

@node Troubleshooting
@chapter Troubleshooting

@cindex troubleshooting
@cindex problems
@cindex issues

@section Common Issues

@subsection Controllers Not Responding

@strong{Problem:} Joystick inputs are not detected.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
Press the GAME SELECT switch to re-detect controllers

@item
Check that controllers are firmly connected to the correct ports

@item
Try pressing a fire button at the Title screen to trigger detection

@item
If using Quadtari, ensure it's properly connected and powered
@end enumerate

@subsection Four Players Not Working

@strong{Problem:} Only 2 players are active despite Quadtari being connected.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
Verify your Quadtari adapter is compatible with Atari VCS

@item
Press GAME SELECT to re-detect the Quadtari

@item
Ensure all four controllers are connected to the Quadtari

@item
Note: Quadtari is detected during Title screen - don't skip it too quickly!
@end enumerate

@subsection Screen Flicker or Slowdown

@strong{Problem:} Graphics appear choppy or unstable.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
This is normal in 4-player mode due to hardware limitations

@item
Health bars and collision detection are intentionally spread across frames

@item
Ensure your console is properly ventilated

@item
Clean the cartridge contacts with isopropyl alcohol
@end enumerate

@subsection Characters Look Wrong

@strong{Problem:} Character colors appear incorrect or hard to distinguish.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
Check the COLOR/B&W switch position:
@itemize @bullet
@item COLOR position: Characters are Blue, Red, Yellow, Green
@item B&W position: Characters are different shades of grey
@end itemize

@item
For black & white TVs, set switch to B&W position for proper brightness levels

@item
Adjust your TV's brightness/contrast for better grey differentiation (B&W mode)

@item
Adjust your TV's colour/tint settings (Colour mode)

@item
Verify correct ROM version (NTSC/PAL/SECAM) for your console
@end enumerate

@subsection Game Won't Start from Multicart

@strong{Problem:} ChaosFight doesn't launch from multicart menu.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
Ensure you have the correct ROM version for your multicart

@item
Some multicarts may require the ".a26" extension to be renamed to ".EFSC"
for proper detection.

@item
When launching from a multicart on Atari 7800, your console may not be
detected as a 7800, and "Black & White" mode will be only enabled while
you hold down the "Pause" button. There is no workaround for this at present.
