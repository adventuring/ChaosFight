@strong{Welcome to ChaosFight!} Get ready for the most exciting fighting game
adventure on the Atari 2600 Video Computer System!

Have you ever dreamed of choosing your favourite fighter and battling it out with
friends? Now you can! ChaosFight brings fast-paced, action-packed combat right
to your living room TV, with 16 amazing characters to choose from - each with
their own unique personality, fighting style, and special abilities!

@strong{What's an Atari 2600?}

The Atari 2600 (also called the Video Computer System, or VCS) is a classic video
game console from 1977 that plugs into your television. It's like a time machine
that lets you experience gaming the way it was in the golden age! You control
the action with a joystick - a simple stick with a button that feels great in
your hand and responds instantly to your every move.

@strong{What Makes ChaosFight Special?}

ChaosFight is designed to bring out the best in the Atari 2600, with features
that make every match exciting:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{16 Unique Fighters!} From the screen-wrapping Bernie to the flying
Magical Faerie, every character plays differently and has their own surprises!

@item
@strong{Play With Friends!} Challenge up to 3 friends at once for chaotic
4-player battles@footnote{Four-player mode requires a Quadtari adapter - a
special device that lets you plug in four controllers at once!}, or go
head-to-head in classic 2-player duels.

@item
@strong{Real Physics!} Characters jump, fall, and get knocked back when hit -
just like in real fighting! Heavy characters move slower but hit harder, while
light characters zoom around the arena with speed and agility.

@item
@strong{Multiple Arenas!} Choose from 16 different battlegrounds, each with
unique platforms, obstacles, and challenges. Will you fight on open ground,
or leap between platforms?

@item
@strong{Easy to Learn!} The simple joystick controls (up, down, left, right,
and one fire button) mean anyone can start playing in seconds - but mastering
each character's special moves takes practice!

@item
@strong{Looks Great on Any TV!} Whether you have a modern colour TV or a
classic black & white set, ChaosFight is designed to look fantastic.
@end itemize

So grab a joystick, pick your favourite fighter, and get ready to rumble! This
manual will teach you everything you need to know to become a ChaosFight champion!

@node Getting Started
@chapter Getting Started

@cindex getting started
@cindex setup
@cindex multicart

Let's get you set up and ready to play! Don't worry if this is your first time
with an Atari 2600 - we'll walk you through every step.

@section What You Need

Before you start your fighting adventure, make sure you have:

@enumerate
@item
@strong{An Atari 2600 Console} - This is the main game system. It's a small
rectangular box with wood-grain trim (or black plastic on later models). On the
front, you'll see a power switch, some other switches, and a slot for game
cartridges. The back has connections for your TV and controllers.

@item
@strong{At least one Joystick Controller} - This is what you'll use to control
your fighter! It looks like a black stick on a square base, with a red button
on the side. You can play with just one joystick, but ChaosFight is way more
fun with friends, so grab as many as you can (up to four)!

@item
@strong{The ChaosFight Game Cartridge} - That's what you're holding! The game
is stored on this cartridge, which slides into the Atari 2600 console.

@item
@strong{A Television} - Any TV with a coaxial (screw-on) antenna connection will
work great! If you have a modern flat-screen TV, you might need a special adapter
box to connect the Atari 2600 (ask at your local electronics store for an
"RF modulator" if you need help).
@end enumerate

@section Let's Get Playing!

Follow these simple steps and you'll be fighting in no time:

@enumerate
@item
@strong{First, make sure everything is OFF!} Turn off your Atari 2600 (if it's
on) and your TV. Safety first!

@item
@strong{Connect your TV.} Attach the cable from your Atari 2600 to your TV's
antenna input. This usually screws on. If you're not sure which connection to
use, look for the one that says "ANT IN" or "RF IN" on your TV.

@item
@strong{Plug in the controllers.} On the back of the Atari 2600, you'll see
two controller ports (they look like rectangular openings). Plug your joystick(s)
into these ports:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Player 1:} Use the @strong{LEFT} port (usually labeled "1")
@item @strong{Player 2:} Use the @strong{RIGHT} port (usually labeled "2")
@item @strong{Players 3 & 4:} If you have a special Quadtari adapter, see
@ref{Controller Configuration} for details on setting up four players!
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Insert the game cartridge.} Find the cartridge slot on top of the Atari
2600 (it's the wide opening). Gently but firmly slide the ChaosFight cartridge
into the slot until it's seated snugly. @emph{Remember: Always insert and remove
cartridges while the power is OFF!}

@item
@strong{Turn on your TV} and select channel 3 or channel 4. (Most Atari 2600s
use channel 3, but check the switch on the back of your console - it should say
"CH 3" or "CH 4".) You might need to use your TV's "Antenna" or "TV" input mode
rather than "Video" or "HDMI."

@item
@strong{Power up the Atari 2600!} Flip the power switch on the console. You
should see the TV screen change - that means it's working!

@item
@strong{Watch the intro!} ChaosFight will show you two special screens:
@itemize @bullet
@item The @strong{Publisher Screen} (AtariAge) with a cool jingle
@item The @strong{Author Screen} (Interworldly Adventuring) with theme music
@item The @strong{Title Screen} with fighters running past
@end itemize

You can press the @strong{red fire button} on any joystick to skip ahead, or
just sit back and enjoy the show!

@item
@strong{Start fighting!} Once you see the title screen, press the fire button
to begin choosing your characters. See @ref{Character Selection} to learn how
to pick your fighter!
@end enumerate

@strong{Troubleshooting Quick Tips:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Black screen?} Make sure your TV is on the right channel (3 or 4) and
set to "Antenna" or "TV" mode.

@item
@strong{Snowy/fuzzy picture?} Try the other channel (3 or 4). Also check that
the cable is screwed on tightly.

@item
@strong{Joystick not working?} Make sure it's plugged in firmly and try pressing
the fire button at the title screen to "wake up" the controller detection.
@end itemize

@strong{Special Note for Multicart Users:}@footnote{Using a multicart device
like a Harmony, Uno, or flash cartridge? These awesome devices let you store
hundreds of games! After turning on your Atari 2600, you'll first see your
multicart's menu. Use your joystick to navigate to the ChaosFight ROM file and
press fire to load it. Check your multicart's instruction manual if you need
help navigating the menu!}

ChaosFight is designed to work with several different types of controllers, so
you can use whatever you have available! The game is smart enough to automatically
figure out which controllers you're using when you press a button at the Title
screen or when you press the Game Select switch on the console.

Let's look at each controller type and how to use it!

This is the classic Atari joystick that probably came with your system! It's a
black stick on a square base with one red button on the upper left corner.

@strong{How to Hold It:}

Hold the controller with the red button in the @strong{upper left}, pointing
toward the TV screen. Rest the base in your palm or on your lap, and use your
thumb or fingers to move the stick.

@strong{How to Use It in ChaosFight:}

@table @strong
@item Moving the Stick
Push the stick in any direction to move your fighter:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{LEFT:} Walk/run left, turn to face left
@item @strong{RIGHT:} Walk/run right, turn to face right
@item @strong{UP:} Jump! (height depends on your character's weight)
@item @strong{DOWN:} Guard stance (blocks all damage for up to 1 second)
@item @strong{Diagonals:} UP+LEFT/RIGHT jumps while moving sideways
@end itemize

@item Red Fire Button
Press the button to attack! Your character will perform their signature move:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Melee characters:} Punch, kick, or slash in the direction you're facing
@item @strong{Ranged characters:} Fire a projectile across the screen
@end itemize

@end group
@end display

Did you know you can use a Sega Genesis or Mega Drive controller with your
Atari 2600? These controllers have a more modern feel and work great with
ChaosFight!

@strong{What You Need:}

A standard 3-button Genesis/Mega Drive controller. These controllers use the
same 9-pin connector as Atari joysticks, so they plug right in! (Note: 6-button
Genesis controllers may not work reliably.)

@strong{How to Use It in ChaosFight:}

@table @strong
@item D-Pad (Directional Pad)
The cross-shaped button pad controls movement:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{LEFT/RIGHT:} Move and turn your fighter
@item @strong{UP:} Jump
@item @strong{DOWN:} Guard (block attacks)
@item @strong{Diagonals:} Press two directions at once for diagonal movement
@end itemize

@item Buttons A, B, or C
@strong{Any of these three buttons works as the Fire button!} Press whichever
one feels most comfortable to you - they all do the same thing in ChaosFight.
@itemize @bullet
@item Attack with your character's weapon
@item Lock in character selection
@item Confirm menu choices
@end itemize

@item START Button
The START button isn't used in ChaosFight (we use the console's Game Select
switch instead for pausing).
@end table

@strong{Why Use a Genesis Controller?}

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{More comfortable:} The ergonomic design fits nicely in your hands
@item @strong{Precise D-pad:} Some players find it easier to hit exact directions
@item @strong{Three buttons:} Even though ChaosFight only needs one button, having
three means you can press whichever one is easiest!
@item @strong{Great for long play sessions:} Less hand fatigue than the CX-40 stick
@end itemize

@strong{Important Note:}

Genesis controllers and Quadtari adapters @strong{don't work together}. If
ChaosFight detects a Genesis controller, it will automatically disable Quadtari
mode. For 4-player games, stick with standard CX-40 joysticks and a Quadtari!

    Fig. C - Joy2B+ Style Controller
@end group
@end display

Joy2B+ controllers are modern enhanced joysticks designed for the Atari 2600.
They add extra buttons and features while staying compatible with classic games!

@strong{What Makes Joy2B+ Special:}

Joy2B+ controllers feature:
@itemize @bullet
@item A classic joystick or modern D-pad design (depends on model)
@item @strong{Two fire buttons} instead of one
@item Additional buttons for special features (varies by model)
@item Modern construction with better durability
@item Often feature USB connectivity for multi-system use
@end itemize

@strong{How to Use It in ChaosFight:}

The controls work just like a standard CX-40 joystick:

@table @strong
@item Directional Control
Move the stick or D-pad to control your fighter:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{UP:} Jump
@item @strong{DOWN:} Guard
@item @strong{LEFT/RIGHT:} Move and turn
@end itemize

@item Fire Buttons
Joy2B+ controllers have multiple fire buttons, but in ChaosFight:
@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Button 1 (primary):} Attack - this is the main fire button
@item @strong{Button 2 (secondary):} Also works for attacking!
@item @strong{Extra buttons:} Not used in ChaosFight (but they won't hurt anything
if you accidentally press them!)
@end itemize
@end table

@strong{Why Choose Joy2B+?}

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Modern build quality:} New controllers, no wear and tear
@item @strong{Two fire buttons:} Use whichever is more comfortable
@item @strong{Comfortable design:} Ergonomic shapes for long gaming sessions
@item @strong{Compatible everywhere:} Works with all Atari 2600 games
@end itemize

@strong{Important Note:}

Like Genesis controllers, Joy2B+ controllers @strong{cannot be used with Quadtari}
for 4-player mode. If you want to play with four players, use standard CX-40
joysticks with a Quadtari adapter!

@section Four-Player Mode with Quadtari

@display
@group
    Quadtari Adapter

    PORT 1 (Even Frame)      PORT 2 (Odd Frame)
    Player 1 / Player 3      Player 2 / Player 4
@end group
@end display

The Quadtari uses time-multiplexing to support four controllers on two ports:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Even frames:} Reads Player 1 (left port) and Player 2 (right port)
@item
@strong{Odd frames:} Reads Player 3 (left port) and Player 4 (right port)
@end itemize

The game automatically detects Quadtari by checking the INPT4/INPT5 lines
during the Title screen.

@section Genesis Controller Mode

Sega Genesis 3-button controllers are supported and provide the same
functionality as standard joysticks:

@table @strong
@item D-Pad
Movement (left, right, up for jump, down for guard)
@item Button A, B, or C
Attack (any button works)
@end table

@strong{Note:} Genesis controllers and Quadtari cannot be used together.
The game will detect which type is connected.

@section Joy2B+ Controller Mode

Joy2B+ enhanced controllers are supported with the same button mapping as
standard joysticks. The additional buttons are not used in ChaosFight.

@strong{Note:} Joy2B+ and Quadtari cannot be used together.

@section Controller Detection

The game detects your controller configuration:

@enumerate
@item
When you press Game Select on the console
@item
When returning to the Title screen from any game mode
@item
During the initial Title screen display
@end enumerate

The detection checks for:
@enumerate
@item
Quadtari adapter (INPT4/INPT5 signature)
@item
Genesis controller (read mode register)
@item
Joy2B+ controller (extended INPT registers)
@item
Standard joysticks (default)

@strong{Hold DOWN on the joystick} before pressing the fire button.

@item
While holding DOWN, @strong{press and hold the FIRE BUTTON} to lock in your
selection.

@item
Your character preview will @strong{freeze in a "recovery" pose} - this is your
visual confirmation that handicap mode is active! The character will no longer
animate, staying in their "recovering from far fall" stance.

@item
Your status bar will still fill with your player colour, showing you're locked
in.
@end enumerate

@strong{What Handicap Mode Does:}

When you activate handicap mode during character selection:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Your starting health is @strong{reduced to 75 points} (instead of the normal 100)

@item
This is a @strong{25% health reduction} - a significant disadvantage!

@item
All other game mechanics remain the same (movement, attacks, damage, etc.)

@item
There's no visual indicator during gameplay, but your health bar will start
shorter than other players
@end itemize

@strong{Why Use Handicap Mode?}

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{Challenge yourself!} Test your skills with less margin for error

@item
@strong{Balance skill gaps:} Let experienced players handicap themselves when
playing with beginners

@item
@strong{Create tournaments:} Use handicaps to make competitions more interesting

@item
@strong{Learn characters:} Practise with handicaps to really master your fighter's
abilities

@item
@strong{Show off:} Beat your friends with one hand tied behind your back (well,
25% less health!)
@end itemize

@strong{Tips for Handicap Play:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Choose heavy characters like Ursulo or Knight Guy - they can take fewer hits,
so their extra weight helps

@item
Perfect your guard timing - you can't afford to take unnecessary damage!

@item
Play defensively - let your opponents make mistakes

@item
Use ranged characters to keep distance and avoid risky close combat

@item
Learn the arenas well - use platforms and obstacles to your advantage
@end itemize

@strong{Visual Confirmation:}

The frozen "recovery pose" during character selection is your guarantee that
handicap mode is active. If the character is still animating normally, you
didn't activate it - try again, making sure to hold DOWN @emph{before} pressing
fire!

@section Character-Specific Tips

@table @strong
@item Bernie
Use your dual-direction attack when surrounded. Your screen wrap is great
for surprise attacks from above!

@item Robo Tito
Your vertical extension reaches the entire screen height. Use it to avoid
ground attacks!

@item Harpy
Maintain flight by rapidly tapping UP. Swoop down for devastating diving attacks!

@item Magical Faerie
Your free flight makes you incredibly mobile, but remember you can't guard!
Stay out of melee range.

@item Curling Sweeper
Your low projectile is hard to jump over. Fire and immediately jump yourself
to create a two-level attack!

@item EXO Pilot
Your long-range missiles are perfect for cross-screen combat. Keep maximum
distance!
