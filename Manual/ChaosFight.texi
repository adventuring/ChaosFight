@node Controller Configuration
@chapter Controller Configuration

@cindex controllers
@cindex joystick

ChaosFight supports multiple controller types with automatic detection. Button
mappings vary by controller type.

@section Standard joystick controllers

@itemize @bullet
@item LEFT/RIGHT
Move and turn character
@item UP
Jump
@item DOWN
Guard
@item Fire Button
Attack. Also used for character and level selection.
@end itemize

Plug Player 1 into left port, Player 2 into right port.

@section Genesis/Mega Drive Controllers

Genesis/Mega Drive controllers supported with automatic detection.

@itemize @bullet
@item Button B (Middle)
Attack. Also used for character and level selection.
@item Button C (Right)
Jump (alternative to UP)
@item Buttons A and START
Not usable (hardware limitation)
@end itemize

Only button B will work when connected through a Quadtari (just like a
standard joystick)

@section Joy2b+ Enhanced Controllers

Joy2B+ controllers are modern enhanced joysticks designed for the Atari Video Computer System,
featuring three fire buttons

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{LEFT/RIGHT:} 
Move and turn your fighter
@item @strong{DOWN:} 
Guard
@item @strong{UP:}
Jump
@item Button I
@strong{Attack}. Also used for character and level selection.

@item Button II
@strong{Jump} - Alternative to UP

@item Button III
@strong{Pause} - Alternative to Game Select
@end itemize


@strong{Important Note:}

Like Genesis/Mega Drive controllers, Joy2B+ controllers' additional buttons
do not work via Quadtari; only Button I will work.

@section Four-Player Mode with Quadtari

Quadtari will be detected automatically if you have it attached when you
power on your system. If not, press Game Select on the title screen or
Character Select screen to re-detect.

The Quadtari must be connected to both Left and Right controller ports
in order to be detected properly.

@page

@c ============================================================
@node Character Selection
@chapter Character Selection

@cindex character selection
@cindex fighters

After the Title screen, each player chooses their fighter by cycling through 
the available characters.

@section The Character Selection Screen

The screen shows character sprites in fixed positions:

@section Selection Controls

@table @strong
@item LEFT/RIGHT
Cycle through characters

@item FIRE
Lock in character selection
@itemize @bullet
@item Playfield border appears around locked sprite
@item Moving joystick after locking will unlock selection
@item Hold DOWN when pressing FIRE to handicap your character.
@end itemize
@end table

A "handicap" for your character starts you with less health. This is
to allow for a more fair fight if playing against a novice player.

@section Starting the Game

The following game play configurations are supported:

@itemize
@item 1 player
To play alone, leave Player 2 set to CPU and select a character
as Player 1. When you
press FIRE, the computer will choose a random character to face off
with you, and the game will start immediately.

If a Quadtari is connected, players 3 and 4 must both be left on "NO."

@item 2 player
To play with two players, move Player 2's selection off "CPU." Both
players must lock in their character with FIRE to proceed.

If a Quadtari is connected, players 3 and 4 must both be left on "NO."

You cannot start a 3- or 4- player game with a CPU player.

@item 3 player
To play with three players, a character must be selected for Players 1 and 2,
 and either Player 3 or 4 must move off "NO" and select a character.
No CPU player is allowed.

@item 4 player
To play with four players, all four players must select a character and then lock them in with FIRE.

@end itemize

If Player 1 locks in their character selection before the other players, it
could start the game. It is advised to let all players make their selections
before Player 1 presses Fire.

@section Handicapping for Advanced Players

Skilled players can start with reduced health for added challenge.

@strong{Activating Handicap Mode:}

@enumerate
@item
Select your character with LEFT/RIGHT

@item
Hold DOWN on the joystick

@item
While holding DOWN, press FIRE to lock selection

@end enumerate

A character will appear "kneeling" (or similar) to indicate the
handicapping is enabled.

Starting health: 75% instead of 100%

@page

@section Guarding

Enter guard stance. While guarding:
@itemize @bullet
@item You take NO damage from attacks
@item You cannot move or attack
@item Guard lasts maximum 1 second
@item Guard cannot be used again for 1 second after previous use
@item You can still be picked up, thrown, and knocked back while guarding
@item Character flashes to indicate guard is active

The console switches provide additional game control:

Pressing the RESET switch immediately returns the the Publisher
screen and restarts the game.

@section GAME SELECT Switch

Pressing the SELECT switch:

@enumerate
@item
Re-detects controller configuration
@item
Pauses the game
@end enumerate

Note, you cannot remove a Quadtari and re-detect from within the game;
perform detection on the Title or Character Select screens.

@section TV TYPE Switch (COLOR/B&W)

On NTSC or PAL systems, when in "COLOR" mode, the playfield will be
colorful.

On SECAM systems, or when in "B&W" mode on NTSC or PAL, the playfield will
be white on black.

Characters are always colored based on player number.

@section DIFFICULTY Switches

The RIGHT DIFFICULTY switch in A (Advanced) position will cause the
CPU player to play at full health in a 1-player game. In the B (Novice)
position, the CPU player will play handicapped (with 75% health)

The LEFT DIFFICULTY switch is NOT used.

@cindex problems
@cindex issues

@section Common Issues

@subsection Controllers Not Responding

@strong{Problem:} Additional controller buttons (C, II, III) are not detected.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate

@item
Check that controllers are firmly connected to the correct ports

@item
Try pressing Game Select at the Title screen to trigger detection

@item
Extra buttons are not supported through the Quadtari.
@end enumerate

@subsection Four Players Not Working

@strong{Problem:} Only 2 players are active despite Quadtari being connected.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate

@item
Press GAME SELECT on the Title or Character Select screen
to re-detect the Quadtari

@end enumerate

@subsection Game Won't Start from Multicart

@strong{Problem:} ChaosFight doesn't launch from multicart menu.

@strong{Solutions:}
@enumerate
@item
Ensure you have the correct ROM version for your multicart

@item
Some multicarts may require the ".a26" extension to be renamed to ".EFSC"
for proper detection.

@item
When launching from a multicart on Atari 7800, your console may not be
detected as a 7800, and "Black & White" mode will be only enabled while
you hold down the "Pause" button. There is no workaround for this at present.
