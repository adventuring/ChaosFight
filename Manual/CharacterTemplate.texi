@c
@c Bernie cannot jump, but he can fall off the bottom of the screen and reappear
@c at the top!
@c
@c His unique "Ground Thump" attack hits both in front AND behind simultaneously,
@c making him dangerous in crowds.
@c He thumps the ground so hard that it affects anyone to either side of him,
@c shoving them rapidly away!
@c
@c Bernie's tough constitution grants complete
@c immunity to fall damage.
