The Dragon of Storms is one of two legendary dragons who united their strengths 
to confront the Seven Dragon Monarchs. These monarchs have unleashed armies of 
griffins, harpies, and other beasts upon the land, threatening all who stand 
in their way. Alongside the Dragon of Embers, the Dragon of Storms must battle 
through seven stages, each containing outdoor areas, indoor sections, and 
confrontations with the powerful Dragon Monarchs themselves.

As the master of storms, this dragon can hover freely (no gravity) and fires 
fireballs, making them excellent for hitting enemies. The Dragon of Storms brings the power of wind and tempest to 
the arena, a formidable force that has faced down monarchs and armies alike.
