Fat Tony used to own some bars in a strange land called "Greewich" but nobody's 
sure where that is, except Fat Tony. He's great at geography and knows all about 
the world of Syrex and Grizzard handlers. He lives on the island of Port Lion now 
and has a magic ring that he uses to shoot lasers.

His expertise in geography and mysterious past make him a formidable opponent who 
knows the terrain better than anyone. The magic ring grants him ranged laser 
attacks, making him dangerous at any distance despite his heavy build.
