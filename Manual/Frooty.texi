Captain of Queen Sugar's royal guard, Frooty is loyal, powerful, hyper, and 
ever so slightly insane. As the one charged with the defence of Fairy Land, 
she carries an enormous responsibility as she leads the queen's armies into 
battle. She also oversees a number of secret research projects in Fairy Land, 
some of which are finally starting to produce results.

Frooty can fly freely up and down using the joystick! However, she cannot 
guard (pressing DOWN makes her fly down instead). Her ranged attack fires 
magical sparkles from her lollipop weapon. This generic fairy archetype 
represents the classic fairy fighter perfectly.
