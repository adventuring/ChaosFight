You are a harpy - swift of wing and vicious in nature. Once banished to a 
deadly labyrinth, you defeated the four keepers of the maze and faced the 
Great Sphinx who exiled you there. The labyrinth contained legendary artifacts 
- feathers of legendary birds and beasts that aided your escape.

Now free of the maze, you bring that hard-won combat experience to ChaosFight. 
Your time battling through the labyrinth's dangers has honed your aerial combat 
skills to perfection. The Harpy can maintain flight by repeatedly jumping, and 
her attack causes her to swoop down diagonally while performing a devastating 
melée strike - techniques perfected during your trials against the maze keepers.
