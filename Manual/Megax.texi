A Grizzard Handler trains Grizzards to attack monsters. Our Grizzard Handler 
will throw "Grizzard eggs" that are lobbed through the air in arcs and hurt 
when they hit you. These skilled trainers understand the nature of both 
Grizzards and the monsters they're trained to fight, making them formidable 
opponents with their unique projectile attacks.
