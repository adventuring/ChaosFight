Pork Chop has had a few jobs. He's worked for fairies, guarded banks, cleaned 
out sewers, and even did a stint on the Edmonton curling team. This diverse 
work experience has given him a well-rounded skill set and the determination 
to handle any situation thrown at him.

From the delicate work with magical fairies to the rough-and-tumble world of 
bank security, from the unpleasant but necessary sewer maintenance to the 
precise sport of curling, Pork Chop has learned to adapt to any environment. 
His heavy build and reliable melée attacks reflect the steady, dependable 
nature that has served him well across all his various careers.
