Radish Goblins are terrible pests that appear in places like Syrex, ancient 
Rome (where they are called vegetable spirits, Karpoi), and Aclypt. Watch out, 
they bounce — and bite.

The Radish Goblin is the lightest character, giving him incredible mobility
but making him more vulnerable to knockback. Their bouncing nature and pest-like
behaviour make them unpredictable opponents who can quickly close distance with
their rapid, erratic movement patterns.
