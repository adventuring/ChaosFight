Robo Tito (a.k.a "Tito el robotito") is a jumpless 
platformer character, a robot that can't jump, but he 
can stretch to reach platforms and hang from them.

Due to a programming error in his system, he is allergic to scary things. To 
his misfortune he is trapped in a place infested with scary things (zombies, 
ghosts, bats, skulls), so he has to look for an exit, avoiding touching those 
spooky items.

Use your joystick controller to move Tito left and right along the floor. You 
can press UP on your controller to stretch Tito up to the ceiling, which he 
will then grab and hang on to. You can then move Tito left and right along 
the ceiling. To get back down to the floor, press DOWN on your joystick until 
Tito reaches the floor.

In ChaosFight, he is vulnerable the entire length to collisions.
