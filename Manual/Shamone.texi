Shamone just wants to protect your vegetable garden from these nasty ducks, 
but they won't stop attacking. This loyal guardian has developed fierce fighting 
skills through constant battles to defend precious vegetables from relentless 
waterfowl invaders.

Despite being a light melée fighter, Shamone's dedication to garden protection 
has made them surprisingly tenacious in combat. When attacking, Shamone jumps 
while striking, allowing for aerial attacks that catch opponents off guard.
