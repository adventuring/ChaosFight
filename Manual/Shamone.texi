Shamone just wants to protect your vegetable garden from these nasty ducks, 
but they won't stop attacking. This loyal guardian has developed fierce fighting 
skills through constant battles to defend precious vegetables from relentless 
waterfowl invaders.

Despite being a light melee fighter, Shamone's dedication to garden protection 
has made them surprisingly tenacious in combat.

Shamone has a unique transformation ability - press UP to transform into a 
different form that shares all of Shamone's combat abilities. This ability 
to switch forms gives Shamone unexpected versatility in battle.
