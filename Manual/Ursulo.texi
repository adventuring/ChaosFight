Ursulo is a bear who has an unfortunate habit of being abducted by wizards, 
robots, and penguins. Despite these constant kidnapping attempts, he's developed 
into a formidable fighter with incredible strength and resilience.

Ursulo is one of the heaviest characters, making him extremely resistant to 
knockback but also giving him a lower jump height. His powerful ranged attack
fires a 2×2 pixel projectile with the highest arc (velocity 7 horizontal, -6
vertical), making it excellent for hitting enemies on platforms! His experience 
dealing with various abductors has made him exceptionally tough and determined.
