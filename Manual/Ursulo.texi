Ursulo is a bear - a 1.67m tall walking polar bear - who has an unfortunate habit 
of being abducted by wizards, robots, and penguins. Despite these constant 
kidnapping attempts, he's developed into a formidable fighter with incredible 
strength and resilience.

His experience dealing with various abductors has made him exceptionally tough and 
determined. His powerful melée claw swipe attack deals significant damage and is 
difficult to interrupt.
