The Veg Dog just wants to protect your vegetable garden from these nasty ducks, 
but they won't stop attacking. This loyal guardian has developed fierce fighting 
skills through constant battles to defend precious vegetables from relentless 
waterfowl invaders.

Despite being a light melée fighter, Veg Dog's dedication to garden protection 
has made them surprisingly tenacious in combat, never backing down from a fight 
when there are vegetables to defend.
