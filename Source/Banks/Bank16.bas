          rem Song Data (bank 16) - Generated By Skylinetool
          rem Note: Pointer tables must be updated with actual addresses
          rem   after compilation
          rem
          rem Songs stored in Bank 16: All songs except OCascadia (1)
          rem and

          rem Songs 0, 3-28 are in this bank
          
          rem Temporary Workaround: Character Theme Songs Commented Out
          rem
          rem ISSUE: Character theme music files are too large for Bank
          rem 16
          rem   ROM space. This is causing build failures due to bank
          rem   overflow.
          rem
          rem STATUS: This is a temporary workaround authorized one-time
          rem to
          rem   unbreak the build. Character theme songs (Song IDs 0,
          rem   3-25) are
          rem   commented out until proper ROM distribution can be
          rem   implemented.
          rem
          rem IMPACT: 
          rem   - Character themes will not play during gameplay
          rem   - Music system will return null pointers for character
          rem   songs
          rem   - Admin screen songs (Chaotica, AtariToday,
          rem   Interworldly) remain
          rem     active and functional
          rem NEXT STEPS (when resuming this work):
          rem
          rem   1. Analyze ROM distribution across all 16 banks
          rem   2. Redistribute character themes to fit within available
          rem   space
          rem   3. Consider compressing or optimizing song data
          rem   4. May need to split character themes across multiple
          rem   banks
          rem   5. Update pointer tables after distribution changes
          rem AFFECTED SONGS (commented out):
          rem   Song 0: Bernie (Character 0 theme)
          rem   Song 3: EXO (Character 3 - ZoeRyen theme)
          rem   Song 4: Grizzards (Character 4 - FatTony theme)
          rem   Song 5: MagicalFairyForce (Character 7 - KnightGuy
          rem   theme)
