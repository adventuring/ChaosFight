; ChaosFight custom includes file
; Licensed under CC0 to match upstream batariBASIC headers.

;
; Includes go below - order is crucial, since this is also the order in which
; they will appear in the generated assembly file
;
; Note: MultiSpriteSuperChip.s is included separately as the header

; this is the batari Basic file
; for bankswitching, the concatenator will only parse until the end of 
; bank 1
bB.asm

; standard kernel: two players, two missiles, a ball and an asymmetric playfield.
multisprite_kernel.asm

; standard startup routine.
startup.asm


; below are collections of subroutines and functions
; if you have any more to add, put them immediately below this line.

std_routines.asm

; Include standard math and utility functions
div_mul.asm
fixed_point_math.asm

; below is the generated batari Basic file
; note: this file is generated by the concatenation program. 
; automatically split off from the bB.asm file where the new bank occurs

bB2.asm


; score gfx
; ChaosFight supplies its own numbers/font system in Bank 16 (Numbers.bas +
; FontRendering), so we do not include the generic batariBASIC
; score_graphics header here. Leaving this enabled appends an extra score
; font block and PF2 data after Bank 16, growing the ROM beyond 64KiB for
; 64kSC and duplicating functionality we already provide.
;score_graphics.asm

;bankswitch support
banksw.asm


; below is the footer, which contains the score digits and startup vectors.
; If you want to create your own custom score digits, you may hack the file below,
; but first you should rename it to something else.
; also includes bankswitching support (if applicable)

; ChaosFight has its own 64kSC EFSC header, reset stub, and vectors defined
; in Source/Common/BankSwitching.s. The legacy 2600basicfooter for EF/EFSC
; would redundantly emit another header/vectors block after Bank 16, causing
; ROM overage and conflicting reset logic, so we disable it here.
