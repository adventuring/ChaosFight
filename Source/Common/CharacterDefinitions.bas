          rem Weight values affect:
          rem   - Jump height (higher weight = lower jump)
          rem   - Movement speed (higher weight = slower)
          rem   - Momentum (higher weight = more momentum when moving)

          rem Values: 1-255 (lower = lighter/faster, higher = heavier/slower/stronger)

          rem 3. Frame compaction:
          rem    - Duplicate frames: compact into single frame reference
          rem    - Gaps: removed during compaction
          rem    - Padding: fill with repeats (1->1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)

          rem 4. Each character needs:
          rem    - 16 animation sequences Ã 8 bytes = 128 bytes frame references
          rem    - Variable number of unique graphics frames Ã 32 bytes = graphics data
          rem    - Total per character: ~128 + (unique_frames Ã 32) bytes
