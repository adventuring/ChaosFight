rem CHARACTER WEIGHTS
rem =================================================================
rem Weight values affect:
rem   - Jump height (higher weight = lower jump)
rem   - Movement speed (higher weight = slower)
rem   - Momentum (higher weight = more momentum when moving)
rem   - Impact resistance (higher weight = less knocked back)
rem   - Melee force (higher weight = more damage/knockback to opponents)
rem Values: 1-255 (lower = lighter/faster, higher = heavier/slower/stronger)

rem DATA FORMAT NOTES FOR SKYLINETOOL OUTPUT
rem =================================================================
rem
rem SkylineTool should emit batariBasic-compatible data in this format:

rem     4, 4, 4, 4, ...            ; 16 bytes color data (using ColBlue macro values)
rem    end
rem
rem 3. Frame compaction:
rem    - Duplicate frames: compact into single frame reference
rem    - Gaps: removed during compaction
rem    - Padding: fill with repeats (1->1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
rem
rem 4. Each character needs:
rem    - 16 animation sequences Ã 8 bytes = 128 bytes frame references
rem    - Variable number of unique graphics frames Ã 32 bytes = graphics data
rem    - Total per character: ~128 + (unique_frames Ã 32) bytes
