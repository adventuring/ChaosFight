          rem NAMING CONVENTIONS:
          rem - Built-in batariBasic identifiers (temp1-temp6, joy0up, frame, etc.) are lowercase
          rem - User-defined variables and labels use PascalCase (GameState, PlayerX, etc.)
          rem - Do NOT use "dim" for built-in variables - they already exist!
          rem - Built-in variables: temp1-temp6, qtcontroller, joy0up/down/left/right/fire, frame
          rem - TIA registers: player0x, player0y, COLUP0, NUSIZ0, pf0-pf2, etc.
          rem - Our variables: GameState, QuadtariDetected, PlayerX, SelectedChar1, etc.
