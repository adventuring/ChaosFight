          rem VARIABLE MEMORY LAYOUT - DUAL CONTEXT SYSTEM
          rem =================================================================
          rem
          rem ChaosFight uses TWO memory contexts that never overlap:
          rem   1. ADMIN context: Title, preambles, character select, level select
          rem   2. GAME context: Active gameplay
          rem
          rem This allows us to REDIM the same memory locations for different
          rem purposes depending on which screen we''re on, maximizing our limited RAM!
          rem
          rem =================================================================
          rem STANDARD RAM (Available everywhere):
          rem   a-z = 26 variables
          rem
          rem SUPERCHIP RAM AVAILABILITY:
          rem   ADMIN screens (pfres=32): var0-var47 available (48 bytes)
          rem   GAME screens (pfres=8):   var0-var23 available (24 bytes)
          rem
          rem SHARED VARIABLES (needed in both contexts):
          rem   - PlayerChar[0-3], PlayerLocked[0-3]
          rem   - SelectedChar1-4, SelectedLevel
          rem   - QuadtariDetected
          rem   - temp1-4, qtcontroller, frame (built-ins)
          rem
          rem REDIMMED VARIABLES (different meaning per context):
          rem   - var0-var23: Different in ADMIN vs GAME
          rem   - w-z: Animation vars (ADMIN) or Missile positions (GAME)

          rem   qtcontroller - Quadtari multiplexing state (0 or 1)
          rem   frame - frame counter (increments every frame)
          
          rem Our variables (need dim):
          dim GameState = g     : rem 0 = normal play, 1 = paused
          dim QuadtariDetected = h  : rem Set during ADMIN, read during GAME
          
          rem Character selection results (set during ADMIN, read during GAME)
          dim PlayerChar = j     : rem [0]=P1, [1]=P2, [2]=P3, [3]=P4 using j,k,l,m
          dim PlayerLocked = n   : rem [0]=P1, [1]=P2, [2]=P3, [3]=P4 using n,o,p,q
