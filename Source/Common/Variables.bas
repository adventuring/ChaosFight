          rem MEMORY LAYOUT - CRITICAL FOR PLAYFIELD COMPATIBILITY:
          rem - During gameplay (pfres=8): var24-var95 are used by playfield data
          rem - Only var0-var23 are available for game variables during gameplay
          rem - During title screens (pfres=12/32): var48+ used by playfield data
          rem - Standard RAM (a-z): 26 bytes always available
          rem - Variable reuse: w-z used for CharSelectAnim* during select, Missile* during gameplay

          rem =================================================================
          rem VARIABLE MEMORY LAYOUT - DUAL CONTEXT SYSTEM
          rem =================================================================

          rem ChaosFight uses TWO memory contexts that never overlap:
          rem   1. ADMIN context: Title, preambles, character select, level select
          rem   2. GAME context: Active gameplay

          rem This allows us to REDIM the same memory locations for different
          rem purposes depending on which screen we are on, maximizing our limited RAM!

          rem =================================================================
          rem STANDARD RAM (Available everywhere):
          rem   a-z = 26 variables

          rem SUPERCHIP RAM AVAILABILITY (with separate read/write ports):
          rem   SuperChip provides 128 bytes additional RAM ($1000-$107F)
          rem   Variables: var0-var127 (128 total)
          rem   Playfield storage at HIGH END, shifts based on pfres setting:

          rem   ADMIN screens (pfres=32): 
          rem     - Playfield uses top 128 bytes: var0-var127 (all 128 bytes!)
          rem     - Available during ADMIN: None from SuperChip (use standard RAM a-z)

          rem   GAME screens (pfres=8):
          rem     - Playfield uses top 32 bytes: var96-var127 (8 rows * 4 bytes)
          rem     - Available during GAME: var0-var95 (96 variables!)

          rem SHARED VARIABLES (needed in both contexts):
          rem   - PlayerChar[0-3], PlayerLocked[0-3]
          rem   - SelectedChar1-4, SelectedLevel
          rem   - QuadtariDetected
          rem   - temp1-4, qtcontroller, frame (built-ins)

          rem REDIMMED VARIABLES (different meaning per context):
          rem   - var0-var23: Different in ADMIN vs GAME
          rem   - w-z: Animation vars (ADMIN) or Missile positions (GAME)
          rem   - i: ReadyCount (ADMIN) or MissilePackedData (GAME)

          rem   qtcontroller - Quadtari multiplexing state (0 or 1)
          rem   frame - frame counter (increments every frame)
          
          rem Our variables (need dim):
          dim GameState = g
