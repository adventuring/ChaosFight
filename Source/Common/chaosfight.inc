; ChaosFight custom includes file
; Licensed under CC0 to match upstream batariBASIC headers.

;
; Includes go below - order is crucial, since this is also the order in which
; they will appear in the generated assembly file
;
; Include the ChaosFight combined header with bank boundary constants
; This replaces multispritesuperchipheader.asm and includes all necessary setup
../../Source/Common/MultiSpriteSuperChip.s

; this is the batari Basic file
; for bankswitching, the concatenator will only parse until the end of 
; bank 1
bB.asm

; standard kernel: two players, two missiles, a ball and an asymmetric playfield.
multisprite_kernel.asm

; standard startup routine.
startup.asm


; below are collections of subroutines and functions
; if you have any more to add, put them immediately below this line.

std_routines.asm

; Include multiplication and division routines
; These are called via jsrbank1() from batariBASIC compiler when
; multiplication/division can't be optimized to bit shifts
div_mul.asm
div_mul16.asm

; Include fixed-point math routines
; These are called via jsrbank1() from batariBASIC compiler for
; fixed-point arithmetic operations (8.8 and 4.4 formats)
fixed_point_math.asm

; below is the generated batari Basic file
; note: this file is generated by the concatenation program. 
; automatically split off from the bB.asm file where the new bank occurs

bB2.asm


; score gfx
score_graphics.asm

;bankswitch support
banksw.asm


; below is the footer, which contains the score digits and startup vectors.
; If you want to create your own custom score digits, you may hack the file below,
; but first you should rename it to something else.
; also includes bankswitching support (if applicable)

2600basicfooter.asm
