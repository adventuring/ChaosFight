Intro:  F     C     D   D/A   D   ( No chord/G -F#-E )

Em                         C            G                        D
Bright burns the sun upon the misty mountain

                      Em                         C            G                          D
Where the woodland waters run and tumble to the sea

                    Em             C         G          D
With the force of your story, O Cascadia

Em                      C     D                        Em
Work of the ages, garden of our dreams

Em                         C                           G                          D
Rich grows the wealth when balance and integrity

         Em                      C                         G                        D
Can cultivate good health and foster industry to be

     Em                      C          G        D
Diverse as your people, O Cascadia

F                         C       D                        Em                                
Capable and just, purposeful and green

             G                        D            F                         C
Let us tend to each season, tempered by reason

Am                       Em            C                            D
Vested and neighborly, joining heart and hand

                 G                        D            Bm                        Em
To be a light among nations when we proclaim

           F                         C            A7                        D
Our pledge to respect, protect and sustain

Em                     C            G                          D
Wise be the ways of happiness and liberty

             Em             C              G                       D
When labor and love partake in harmony

             Em                      C        G        D
With a mind for the future, O Cascadia

Em                      C                D                        Em
Peaceful the homeland, bountiful and free

F                         C                          D                          C        G
Long live the homeland, bountiful and free
