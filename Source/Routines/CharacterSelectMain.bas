          rem =================================================================
          rem Main character selection screen with Quadtari support.
          rem Players cycle through 16 characters and lock in their choice.

          rem FLOW:
          rem   1. Detect Quadtari adapter
          rem   2. Initialize selections (all unlocked)
          rem   3. Loop: handle input with multiplexing
          rem   4. Update animations
          rem   5. Draw screen
          rem   6. Check if ready to proceed

          rem QUADTARI MULTIPLEXING:
          rem   Even frames (qtcontroller=0): joy0=P1, joy1=P2
          rem   Odd frames (qtcontroller=1): joy0=P3, joy1=P4

          rem AVAILABLE VARIABLES:
          rem   PlayerChar[0-3) - Selected character indices (0-15)
          rem   PlayerLocked[0-3) - Lock state (0=unlocked, 1=locked)
          rem   QuadtariDetected - Whether 4-player mode is active
          rem   ReadyCount - Number of locked players
