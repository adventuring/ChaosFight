          rem FALL DAMAGE SYSTEM
          rem =================================================================
          rem Handles fall damage detection and application based on:
          rem   - Vertical velocity at landing
          rem   - Character weight (heavier = shorter safe fall distance)
          rem   - Character-specific immunities and reductions

          rem FALL DAMAGE RULES:
          rem   - Safe fall distance inversely proportional to weight
          rem   - Average-weight character: ~64 pixels (1/3 of 192 screen height)
          rem   - Fall damage proportional to distance beyond safe threshold
          rem   - Triggers damage recovery animation and color shift (darker)

          rem CHARACTER EXCEPTIONS:
          rem   - Bernie (0): NO fall damage (immune)
          rem   - Robo Tito (13): NO fall damage (immune)
          rem   - Frooty (8): NO gravity (no falling)
          rem   - Ninjish Guy (10): 1/2 fall damage (reduced)
          rem   - Harpy (6): Reduced gravity (1/2 rate) when falling
          rem   - Dragonet (2): Reduced gravity (1/2 rate) when falling

          rem GRAVITY CONSTANTS:
          rem   - Normal gravity: 2 pixels/frame acceleration
          rem   - Reduced gravity (Harpy/Dragonet): 1 pixel/frame
          rem   - Terminal velocity: 8 pixels/frame (cap on fall speed)

          rem VARIABLES USED:
          rem   - PlayerY[0-3]: Vertical position
          rem   - PlayerMomentumY (temporary): Vertical velocity
          rem   - PlayerRecoveryFrames[0-3]: Hitstun/recovery timer
          rem   - PlayerHealth[0-3]: Health to reduce
          rem   - temp1: Player index
          rem   - temp2: Fall velocity at impact
          rem   - temp3: Safe fall distance threshold
          rem   - temp4: Fall damage amount
          rem   - temp5: Character type
          rem   - temp6: Character weight
