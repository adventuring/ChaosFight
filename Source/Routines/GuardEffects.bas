          rem GUARD VISUAL EFFECTS SYSTEM
          rem =================================================================
          rem Implements guard flashing visual feedback as specified in manual:
          rem - Character flashes light cyan ColCyan(12) in NTSC/PAL
          rem - Character flashes Cyan in SECAM
          rem - Guard lasts maximum 1 second (60 frames)
          rem - Guard cannot be used again for 1 second after previous use
