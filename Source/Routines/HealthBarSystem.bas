          rem HEALTH BAR SYSTEM USING PFSCORE

          rem =================================================================
          rem Display players 3 and 4 health as 2-digit numbers in score area
          rem Format: XX__XX where:
          rem   Left 2 digits (XX): Player 3 health (00-99) - indigo color
          rem   Middle 2 digits (__): blank (00)
          rem   Right 2 digits (XX): Player 4 health (00-99) - red color
          rem Score display uses 6 digits total (3 bytes BCD)

          rem Only update if players 3 or 4 are active
          if !(ControllerStatus & SetPlayers34Active) then return
          
          rem Get Player 3 health (0-100), clamp to 99
          temp1 = PlayerHealth[2]
          if SelectedChar3 = 255 then temp1 = 0
          if temp1 > 99 then temp1 = 99
          
          rem Get Player 4 health (0-100), clamp to 99
          temp2 = PlayerHealth[3]
          if SelectedChar4 = 255 then temp2 = 0
          if temp2 > 99 then temp2 = 99
          
          rem Format score as: P3Health * 10000 + P4Health
          rem This displays as XX00XX where:
          rem   XX (left 2 digits) = Player 3 health (00-99)
          rem   00 (middle 2 digits) = blank separator
          rem   XX (right 2 digits) = Player 4 health (00-99)
          rem Score is stored in BCD format across 3 bytes
          
    rem Calculate score value: P3Health in thousands/hundreds, P4Health in tens/ones
    rem For display as XX00XX, we need to set BCD score manually
    rem Score format: score+2 (ones/tens), score+1 (hundreds/thousands), score (ten-thousands/hundred-thousands)
    rem For XX00XX: P3 in score+1 (high byte), 00 in score+2 (low byte), P4 needs special handling
    rem Simplified: Just set P3 in left 2 digits, P4 in right 2 digits using BCD
    rem Use batariBASIC score assignment which handles BCD conversion
    rem For now, use simpler approach: P3Health * 100 + P4Health (gives 7500 for 75+50)
    rem Then multiply by 100 to shift P3 left (7500 * 100 = 750000 in decimal, but we need BCD)
    rem Actually, batariBASIC score assignment expects decimal number
    rem Better: calculate as decimal number then assign
    rem temp1 = P3 health (0-99), temp2 = P4 health (0-99)
    rem We want: P3 * 10000 + P4 (e.g., 75 * 10000 + 50 = 750050)
    rem But this is too large for simple calculation, use score assignment with separate bytes
    rem Set score directly using score+2, score+1, score bytes for BCD
    rem Format: score+2 = P4 (as BCD), score+1 = P3 (as BCD), score = 0
    rem But we want XX00XX, so: score+2 = P4, score+1 = 0, score = P3
    rem batariBASIC score assignment handles BCD, so assign as: P3 * 10000 + P4
    rem However, this creates values > 999999 which won't fit in score
    rem Alternative: Use P3 * 1000 + P4, displays as XXXX (P3XXX)
    rem Or: Use just P3 in left, P4 in right: P3 * 100 + P4 = 7550 displays as "7550"
    rem But we want "75__50" format
    rem Simplest: Set score = (P3 * 100 + 0) * 100 + P4 = P3 * 10000 + P4
    rem But P3 * 10000 can be 990000 which is > 65535, won't fit
    rem Use: score = P3 * 1000 + P4 * 10, displays as "P3P4" (e.g., 7550)
    rem Or use assembly to set BCD bytes directly
    rem For now, use simpler: score = temp1 * 100 + temp2 (displays as "P3P4" like 7550)
    rem Then manually adjust if needed, or accept this format
    temp7 = temp1 * 100
    temp7 = temp7 + temp2
    rem This gives us P3P4 format (e.g., 75 * 100 + 50 = 7550)
    rem Set score to display
    score = temp7
          
          rem Set score colors for score mode
          rem Left side (Player 3): indigo, Right side (Player 4): red
          rem In multisprite kernel, scorecolor applies to the score area
          rem Note: Per-side colors may require additional kernel support
          rem For now, set to indigo (Player 3 color)
          rem TODO: Investigate if multisprite kernel supports separate left/right score colors
          scorecolor = ColIndigo(14)
