          rem =================================================================
          rem NOTE: This implementation is FUBAR and needs to be rebuilt from
          rem      scratch based on requirements in GitHub issues (#162, #243, #306).
          rem      Requirements:
          rem      - Music must come from assets, not hard-coded in sources
          rem      - Music is polyphony 2, sound effects polyphony 1
          rem      - Sound effects use first-come, first-served voices
          rem      - Music and sound effects must properly share TIA audio channels
          rem
          rem Provides music playback using TIA audio channels
          rem Maps one "channel" to 2 voices (AUDC0 + AUDC1)
          rem No backlog/queue - lower priority sounds not considered
          rem Uses AUDC0 for melody, AUDC1 for harmony/rhythm

          rem MusicTimer - Frame counter for timing
          rem MusicChannel0 - AUDC0 data for melody
