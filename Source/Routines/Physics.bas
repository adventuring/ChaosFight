rem   - Movement speed resistance
rem   - Impact resistance

rem Weight values (from CharacterDefinitions.bas):
rem Bernie: 21, Curling: 25, Dragonet: 20, EXO Pilot: 23
rem Fat Tony: 22, Grizzard Handler: 20, Harpy: 19, Knight Guy: 12
rem Magical Faerie: 17, Mystery Man: 18, Ninjish Guy: 40, Pork Chop: 15
