          rem PLAYER ELIMINATION SYSTEM
          rem =================================================================
          rem Handles player elimination when health reaches 0, game end conditions,
          rem and removal of eliminated players from active gameplay systems.
          rem
          rem ELIMINATION PROCESS:
          rem   1. Detect when player health reaches 0
          rem   2. Set elimination flag and play elimination effects
          rem   3. Remove player from active input/physics/collision systems
          rem   4. Hide player sprite and health bar
          rem   5. Check for game end conditions (1 player remaining)
          rem
          rem VARIABLES:
          rem   PlayersEliminated - Bit flags for eliminated players
          rem   PlayersRemaining - Count of active players
          rem   GameEndTimer - Countdown to game end screen
