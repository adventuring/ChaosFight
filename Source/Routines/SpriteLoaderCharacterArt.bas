          rem Wrapper that determines correct bank and switches to it
          rem Input: temp1 = character index (0-31)
          rem        temp2 = animation frame (0-7) from sprite 10fps counter, NOT global frame

          rem Output: Player sprite pointer set to character artwork
          rem Note: Frame is relative to sprite own 10fps counter, NOT global frame counter
