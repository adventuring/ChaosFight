	; For 48×42 bitmaps using ×2 drawing style (double-height mode)
	; Each bitmap row is displayed as 2 scanlines: 42 rows → 84 scanlines on screen
	; Three admin screens use three different minikernel slots:
	;   - 48x2_1: Publisher (AtariAge logo) bitmap
	;   - 48x2_2: Author (Interworldly) bitmap  
	;   - 48x2_3: Title (ChaosFight) bitmap
	; Publisher screen: Shows 48x2_1 (logo) + 48x2_2 (text) - both window=42
	; Author screen: Shows only 48x2_2 (Interworldly) - window=42
	; Title screen: Shows only 48x2_3 (ChaosFight) - window=42
	; Each screen activates only its minikernel by setting height/window = 0 for others
	; OR: Use conditional layout based on GameMode variable
	; Removed draw_48x2_1 and draw_48x2_2 - only ChaosFight title screen is used
