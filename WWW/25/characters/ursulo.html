            <p>Ursulo is a bear - a 1.67m tall walking polar bear - who has an unfortunate habit of being abducted by wizards, robots, and penguins. Despite these constant kidnapping attempts, he's developed into a formidable fighter with incredible strength and resilience. His experience dealing with various abductors has made him exceptionally tough and determined. His powerful mêlée claw swipe attack deals significant damage and is difficult to interrupt.</p>
