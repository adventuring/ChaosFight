I will refer you to GitHub issues for this project (use the "gh" command to read them)

Review the source code including Source/Requirements.md and Source/StyleGuide.md

Study the history and comments on each ticket. Then

1. Determine if it can be trivially implemented with no further work. If it can, do so: implement
   the feature or bug fix. Commit with a detailed commit message, comment on and close the issue.

2. If it cannot be trivially implemented in its current form, determine if it can be broken down
   into subtasks which (some or all) can be trivially implemented. Push these as GitHub issues and
   link them to the main task. Then, review these subtasks and implement as per (1.) any which can be
   done, sequentially. If all are implemented successfully, close the main issue as well.

Interview me if you encounter contradictory or confusing information before you begin work.

We will continue in this way with several ticket numbers.
